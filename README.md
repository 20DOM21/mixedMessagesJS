## General info:
* This project is part of Codecademys Full-Stack Engineering Path.
* Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output (inspirational message).
* To make the program truly random, the message that it outputs is made up of three different pieces of data. 

## Technologies:
* JavaScript
* Markdown 
* Visual Studio Code 1.63.0
* Node.js: 14.16.0
	
## Launch:
* Make sure you have Node.js downloaded beforehand.
* To run this program, you need to choose a local directory where the files will be stored, using your GitBash command line / terminal:
``` 
$ cd [name of your directory]
```
* Alternatively, create a new one first:
```
$ mkdir [name of your directory]
$ cd [name of your directory]
```
* Then, you may simply copy the following and paste it into your GitBash command line / terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/20DOM21/mixedMessagesJS.git
cd mixedMessagesJS
node mixedMessages.js
```
* To get a new message, simply re-run the program by retyping / re-pasting the last command:
```
node mixedMessages.js
```
